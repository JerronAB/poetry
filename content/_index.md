This website is mainly focused on being a simple repository of poems I've written over time. You can learn more on the [about me](/about/) page, or you can jump right into the poems (which is what I recommend). 

The uncomfortable mix of fonts on this site is intentional. They serve to stylistically separate the different types of content.
