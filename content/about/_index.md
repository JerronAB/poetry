I'm an electrical engineering student, with a day job as a database administrator. I spend a little free time playing around with web technologies as well, which led to this website. My interests include math and disc golf—

One of my main requirements for this website is that it feels snappy and instant. For that reason, I don't use any frameworks or fetch any external content. I use a static site generator, Hugo, and a custom theme. If you're familiar with Hugo, feel free to make suggestions about my theme setup on the GitHub repo.  

To-do list for the site:
 - ~**finalize pretty vs computerized styles**~
 - **better menu at the top**
 - Aesthetic improvements in general
 - Figure out a better summary method
 - Make the Hugo layout a little more idiosyncratic
