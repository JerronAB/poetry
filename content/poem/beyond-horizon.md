At the horizon, in my mind  
There is an infinite little space  
Where I can reserve hope that there is no such thing, as **No More**.  

I will look into it here and there  
And think of where you've gone.  

---  

I shall look into the distance, now  
Where earth, and skyline meet.   
And forever know, that you are there.   
Unmistakably   
At peace.
