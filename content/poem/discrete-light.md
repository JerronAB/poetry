Interesting little circuits   
Configured like a brain, perhaps.  
Little nascent impulses, like twitches   
Begin your creature-breath in 5-volt lines  
The nervous system of a small and simple existence   
And the factory printers, *"your warm mother"*

When I pull the plug I watch your light go out slowly  
But then a sputter, a dying breath, and a small pop  
Like I watched your soul fly out from my hands,   
Tethered by this umbilical, copper embrace 

I can look at the moon right now and see deep  
Smooth gradients painted into the sky  
But your existence is discretizedâ€”tiny bits that form  
Every little quanta, of thought  
...
