You are a million miles away  
With a surface made from  
A weak and *nothing* material  
We will not see your soul when it bursts  
With blinding light, outside  

---

I sit beside you reading  
It's completely silent, like a vaccuum  
Took all of the air from the room  
I turn my head to look at you, my neck makes no noise  
Against the fabric of my jacket  

Something isn't right with your image.  
I trace every shadow and line  
Seeking a subject of visual scrutiny  
And finally pin down, under your arms, a glow  
That hasn't always been there.  
Bright orange--where is it coming from?  
I broaden my search  
Eyes sweeping rapidly across you  
Until at once, the gestalt before me comes into focus  
You are lit from underneath  
Your entire being  
Has an iron-hot silhouette  
Like an event has begun
