Your absence leaves a quiet in the room 

We are watching you  
Leave this poorly draped cloth  
That soon will not contain your Glory  
Underneath is a beautiful pool of life  
And it retreats ever deeper in your bones  
Shying from this weak material exterior  
Cocooning something so beautiful  
That I can hardly imagine  
Where you are going
