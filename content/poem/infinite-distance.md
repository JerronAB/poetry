From dust, to dust.  
Atop the roots of a small tree of life  
My mother and I  
Are a rich, fertile soil  
Into which your hands dig  
I can see you now; you look young.

With a grunt, you   
Leave us your best traits.   
An unrefined mass of commitment  
And a fashion of work that  
Makes the pain go away in time
