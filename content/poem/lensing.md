Something burns so brightly  
On the other side of this worn surface.  
Chalky, fragile, stretched so tight  
A gray curtain hiding this  
Raging, turbulent, powerful energy.  

In this room I can only hear your breath  
But beneath it is a deep roar  
Ready to be set free  
As your surface turns to embers  
And you escape so beautifully  
From our sight
