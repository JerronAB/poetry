Through frosted glass  
You natural, interesting people, talk.  
Suave and vital characters that  
Fit together like puzzle pieces  

Each of you is a calm outline  
With its perfect ready spot, available  
I watch you settle with so much comfort  
In the same room as me  
*But there's frosted glass between us*  
My breath against a window, I'm staring  
At you natural, interesting people.

I wimper as if I'm beneath the floorboards  
Like me, like me, like me, all of you.  
Like me, like me, like me, damn you.
