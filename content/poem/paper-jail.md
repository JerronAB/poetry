This tight and humid skin is only  
A paper jail for you  
A shell. Fragile, weak  
And ready to leave.  
 
We only see some small and  
Quiet side  
Of an incredible transaction  

You look up and to the left, for hours  
And wait for glory to wrap around you  
Something much more beautiful  
Awaits
