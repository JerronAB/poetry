There are many others  
That those eyes admire  
More delicately.  
And artfully.  
Than I.

So I surmise  
That you are unreal  
When they trace me  
My reflection stares   
Baffled  
In its halo frame

And when you look away  
I am taken,  
In anguished pieces. 

For this is a prison   
I have entered,  
By choice.
