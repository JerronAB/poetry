I put your brain together  
In little chips beneath my hands  
With rough solder-work to fuse your systems.  
And instructions to fill your thoughts.  

You come to life in sampled blasts of voltage  
First a beating heart: something, nothing.  
Something, nothing.  
You wake by reading bits tucked away in  
A little continuous space in your memory.
