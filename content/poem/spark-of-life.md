our eyes create a unique sentience  
in the space between us  
they dance to a melody  
no one else has ever heard  
or will ever hear  

---

a spark of life  
is defined by our sightlines  
thready impulses  
with form and function undefined  
but nevertheless present


breathing, growing  
tracing rays between us
