I hear crickets, cicadas, breeze  
My childhood song  
And I feel wholly myself,  
In the damp air. 

...

The leaves  
Stare toward me  
In the moonlight.

The branches dance at once, together  
To a song beneath the air.

I wonder what they would say about me.  
I'm not here, in the night.   
Only my childhood song.

And I wish to meet you.
